ABSTRACT  
The study, Development of Electronic Communication Chat (EC CHAT), aims to provide a 
social networking in a star topology connection inside inbound vicinity that helps students and 
faculty members to socialize and share files or information to one another without the use of 
internet. The system is capable of establishing wireless connection which provides all the 
social networking features and services inside its premises. It has the features of advisories, 
chatting, profiling, file sharing, blocking, repor ting, and secured identification process. It also 
has an enhanced security that provides a trusted network connection to all client users. The 
application displays all the functions using graphical user interface to access all the features of 
the system. T he system was developed using Android Studio for Android application 
development, Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) and JavaScript a scripting language for web 
development, and open source web technologies such as HTML, and CSS for web pages and 
web application . Test results showed that the application software can be installed in any 
Android device running on Android 4.3 version and above without incompatibility issues and 
all test data were processed as expected in terms of speed and accuracy. The system was 
evaluated by 50 evaluators composed of Information Technology professors, professionals, 
and students under the Electronics Department of Technological University of the Philippines 
- Manila using ISO 25010 software quality model and was rated with a an ove rall mean of 4.64 
with a descriptive rating of “Excellent.” This signifies that the system is useful to all students 
and faculty members in terms of social networking inside its vicinity.

G.  BODY OF THE RESEARCH  
Chapter  1 - INTRODUCTION  
Background of the Study  
Describe the scenario that poses problems and concerns needed to be addressed. 
Connect this situation to the proposed project.  
 It is composed of a  brief statement of the origin of the problem . It also includes  the 
main reasons for the conduct of the study . It starts  with an opening statement about the main 
topic leading to the specific topic  followed by a discussion on the specific topic leading to the 
problem identification . Lastly, a statement of the solution is presented  
• 1st paragraph - opening statements about the main topic leading to your specific topic  
• Multi -platform /Multiplayer game using mobile phones /PC 
• 2nd paragraph – discussion on the specific topic leading to your main problem  
• . Why does latency matter for gamers?  
• Speed is a crucial element for any gamer. As  a real -time experience, 
gaming only functions when communication between the game and the 
players is instant.  
• A delay of even a few milliseconds between command and response 
could change the outcome of a game. This means it takes very little for 
latency to be considered significant.  
• Data packets never arrive at all  (data loss)  
• 3rd paragraph – presentation of your main problem  
• Network Latency issues  -  latency  is the delay between you giving a 
command, and the game executing it. This delay is the time it takes to transmit 
data packets over a network, and is closely associated with another issue 
called  packet loss. The longer it  takes for data to make the return  trip between 
your device and the game server, the greater the latency  
• 4th paragraph – evidence  that the problem really exists  
• Rubberbanding  
• In severe cases, latency can mean that some data packets may never 
arrive at all. This means vital interactions with the game may be lost 
altogether. This distorts your gameplay and creates an undesirable 
visual effect called “rubberbanding”. This is when objects in the game 
jump from one place to another without passing through the space in 
between. This is sometimes also known as warping.  
• 5th paragraph – present the causes and effects of the main problem  
• Cause:  
• Bandwidth limitations  
• Bandwidth is a measure of how much data can be transmitted 
over your internet connection at once. In other words, it indicates 
how many connected devices, and individual apps can run 
smoothly in tandem, using the same connection.  
11 
 • Distance from server/Network infrastructure  
• Gaming is a transmission of data between your ISP server and  
the game’s server. The further you are from your ISP server, 
the longer the process will take – and the more likely you are 
to encounter ping.   
• Effect:  
• Latency causes poor user experience – Hanging, jittering, lagging.   
• This is a problem because delays hinder the user experience and also 
make it more or less impossible to compete.  
• 6th paragraph – presentation of a perceived solution to the problem and its strategy  
• special networks with optimized routing  – from previous research  
• New routing algorithm or techniques/methods  – from previous research  
• Used machine learning to find optimized paths between your network and 
gaming servers, which help to reduce latency, reduce packet loss, and improve 
stability. -from previous research  
• Automated  application to increase  polling rate -Higher polling rate means that 
your mouse can deliver more frequent clicks and movements -from previous 
research  
Objectives of the Study  
General Objective  
The general objective captures the title of the study. It is broad enough to 
include all aspects of the subject matter, yet brief and concise as possible.  
Specific Objectives  
• The specific objectives must be explicit, precise, and expected results are 
verifiable.  
• The criteria of SMART must be considered in setting the specific objectives.  
• The SMART goal method is a concept that can help software engineers 
set more effective goals. SMART is an acronym that stands for  specific, 
measurable, attainable, relevant, and time -based.  
• Specific:  When developing your software engineering goals, be as detailed as 
possible. Whether you  reach  success  or not entirely depends on it. To illustrate, 
instead of “I will be a better coder,” you could try, “I will improve my code 
performance by 15%.”  
• Measurable:  Make sure your goals are measurable; this criterion is essential to 
being a successful software engineer. Otherwise, you risk losing fuel as time goes on.  
• Attainable:  Accomplishing your  engineering  goals  and objectives  shouldn’t be a 
breeze. Try to find a proper balance between realistic and challenging.  
• Relevant:  Don’t sell short the importance of aligning software engineering goals 
with values. Ask yourself,” Does meeting this goal make me a better engineer, even 
if a little bit?” If the answer is no, it might not be worthwhile.  
• Time -based:  A timeline creates a sense of urgency to pursue your goals with zeal. If 
you lack an end date, you’ll likely lose focus on your journey to success.  
- Design the application/ prototype  (no software/hardware 
involved)  
• Design a special network infrastructure for a 
multiplayer mobile game to reduce game latency  
12 
 - Fabricate or develop  the application/ prototype  using ( a 
software /hardware , mechanism etc. or according to a set of 
parameter or standard)  
• Develop the network infrastructure usi ;(hardware and 
software that will be used in developing the 
application/prototype ) 
- Determine the performance or acceptability of the project  
(testing procedures and improv ement ) 
• Test case form; testing procedure documents  
- Evaluate  (Result of evaluation)  
• Using software/hardware evaluation criteria that uses 
Likert scale ; Likert scale is a psychometric scale used in 
research questionnaires to measure respondents' level of 
agreement or disagreement on a series of statements  
(1,2,3,4,5 measuring number)   
Scope and Limitation s of the Study  
• The scope of the study includes what the study is all about, the reason why the 
study is conducted and how it will be made.  
• The major methodologies of developing the prototype together with the 
important components are presented.  
• Also included is who are the beneficiaries and how will they benefit from the 
project.  
• The limitations are the factors which set the boundaries covered in the study.  
• Significance of the Study (for proposal only)  
Chapter  2 - CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK  
 Review of Related Literature  and Studies   
• The purposes of this section are to tell what research has or has not been done on the 
problem and to explain and clarify the theoretical rationale of the problem.  
• Only studies, which are  related in purpose , method, or findings of the study, should 
be included.  
• The discussion of such studies should be in the form of a brief critical analysis of the 
purposes, method of study, principal findings and conclusions.  
 Conceptual Model of the Study  
• This is represented in a diagram using the Input -Process -Output (IPO) model in 
developmental research.  
• The INPUT block consists of the Knowledge Requirements, Software Requirements 
and/or Hardware Requirements.  
• The PROCESS block presents the activities involved in the Design, Development, 
Implementation, and Evaluation stages.  
• With the input and process requirements laid out, the expected OUTPUT becomes 
achievable.  
13 
 Operational Definition of Terms  
• Includes only the terms, words, or phrases, which have special or unique meanings in 
the study and the definitions of how they are used in the study.  
• They are identified and listed as they appear in the research document starting with 
the title.  
• The definitions should be brief and clear as possible.

Introduction both at center alignment)  
C. Introduction : The introduction (which is not labeled) begins on the line 
following the paper title.  
IV. Text citations:  Source material must be documented in the body of the paper 
by citing the author(s) and date(s) of the sources.  The underlying principle is 
that ideas and words of others must be formally acknowledged.  The reader can 
obtain the full source citation from t he list of references that follows the body 
of the paper.  
17 
 A. When the names of the authors of a source are part of the formal 
structure of the sentence, the year of publication appears in parentheses 
following the identification of the authors.  Consider the following 
example:  
Wirth and Mitchell (1994) found that although there was a reduction in 
insulin dosage over a period of two weeks in the treatment condition 
compared to the control condition, the difference was not statistically 
significant. [ Note:  and is used when multiple authors are identified as 
part of the formal structure of the sentence.  Compare this to the 
example in the following section.]  
B. When the authors of a source are not part of the formal structure of the 
sentence, both the authors and year of publication appear in parentheses. 
Consider the following example:  
Reviews of research on religion and health have concluded that at least 
some types of religious behaviors are related to higher levels of physical 
and mental health (Gartner, Larson, & Allen, 1991; Koenig, 1990; 
Levin & Vanderpool, 1991; Maton & Pargament,  1987; Paloma & 
Pendleton, 1991; Payne, Bergin, Bielema, & Jenkins, 1991).  [Note:  & 
is used when multiple authors are identified in parenthetical material. 
Note also that when several sources are cited parenthetically, they are 
ordered alphabetically by f irst authors' surnames and separated by 
semicolons.]  
C. When a source that has two authors is cited, both authors are included 
every time the source is cited.  
D. When a source that has three, four, or five authors is cited, all authors 
are included the first time the source is cited. When that source is cited 
again, the first author's surname and "et al." are used.  Consider the 
following example:  
Reviews of research on religion and health have concluded that at least 
some types of religious behaviors are related to higher levels of physical 
and mental health (Payne, Bergin, Bielema, & Jenkins, 1991).  
Payne et al. (1991) showed that ...  
E. When a source that has six or more authors is cited, the first author's 
surname and "et al." are used every time the source is cited (including 
the first time).  
F. Every effort should be made to cite only sources that you have actually 
read.  When it is necessary to cite a source that you have not read 
("Grayson" in the following example) that is cited in a source that you 
have read ("Murzynski & Degelman" in the foll owing example), use the 
following format for the text citation and list only the source you have 
read in the References list:  
18 
 Grayson (as cited in Murzynski & Degelman, 1996) identified four 
components of body language that were related to judgments of 
vulnerability.  
G. To cite a personal communication (including letters, emails, and 
telephone interviews), include initials, surname, and as exact a date as 
possible.  Because a personal communication is not "recoverable" 
information, it is not included in the References sect ion. For the text 
citation, use the following format:  
B. F. Skinner (personal communication, February 12, 1978) claimed ...  
H. To cite a Web document, use the author -date format.  If no author is 
identified, use the first few words of the title in place of the author.  If no 
date is provided, use "n.d." in place of the date.  Consider the following 
examples:  
Degelman (2009) summarizes guidelines for the use of APA writing 
style.  
Changes in Americans' views of gender status differences have been 
documented ( Gender and Society , n.d.).  
I. To cite the Bible, provide the book, chapter, and verse.  The first time 
the Bible is cited in the text, identify the version used.  Consider the 
following example:  
"You are forgiving and good, O Lord, abounding in love to all who call 
to you" (Psalm 86:5, New International Version).    [Note:  No entry in 
the References list is needed for the Bible.]  
V. Quotations:  When a direct quotation is used, always include the author, year, 
and page number as part of the citation.  
A. A quotation of fewer than 40 words should be enclosed in double 
quotation marks and should be incorporated into the formal structure of 
the sentence. Consider the following example:  
Patients receiving prayer had "less congestive heart failure, required 
less diuretic and antibiotic therapy, had fewer episodes of pneumonia, 
had fewer cardiac arrests, and were less frequently intubated and 
ventilated" (Byrd, 1988, p. 829).  
B. A lengthier quotation of 40 or more words should appear (without 
quotation marks) apart from the surrounding text, in block format, with 
each line indented five spaces from the left margin.  
19 
 VI. References : All sources must be included in the References  section.  
A. Pagination : The References  section begins on a new page.  
B. Heading : "REFERENCES " (centered on the first line)  
C. Format : The References  (with hanging indent) begin s on the line 
following the References  heading.  Entries are organized alphabetically 
by surnames of first authors.  Most reference entries have the 
following  components:  
1. Authors: Authors are listed in the same order as specified in the 
source, using surnames and initials.  Commas separate all 
authors.  When there are eight or more authors, list the first six 
authors followed by three ellipses (...) and then the final 
author.  If no author is identified, the title of the document begins 
the reference.  
2. Year of Publication: In parentheses following authors, with a 
period following the closing parenthesis. If no publication date 
is identified, use "n.d." in parentheses following the authors.  
3. Source Reference: Includes title, journal, volume, pages (for 
journal article) or title, city of publication, publisher (for 
book).  Italicize titles of books, titles of periodicals, and 
periodical volume numbers.  
4. Electronic Retrieval Information: Electronic retrieval 
information may include digital object identifiers (DOIs) or 
uniform resource locators (URLs).  DOIs are unique 
alphanumeric identifiers that lead users to digital  source 
material. To learn whether an a rticle has been assigned a DOI,
